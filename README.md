## Overview
This project features an interactive dashboard for analyzing yearly airline performance using Python, Plotly, and Dash. The dashboard provides visual insights into various aspects of airline operations, including flight cancellations, delays, and performance metrics across different airlines.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks/Yearly Airline Performance Report and Dashboard.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the interactive dashboard. It includes sections for importing libraries, handling errors, reading airline data, and defining functions to compute data for visualizations. The notebook also sets up the layout for the dashboard and defines callback functions to update the graphs based on user input.
  
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the dependencies required for the project, including specific versions of libraries such as pandas, dash, and plotly, ensuring that the environment can be replicated.

## Instructions for Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/Yearly Airline Performance Report and Dashboard.ipynb
   ```
5. Run the cells in the notebook to launch the interactive dashboard.
